ðŸš€ Sales Analytics Dashboard for DMart ðŸš€

ðŸ“Š I recently developed a sales analysis dashboard that provides real-time insights into the performance of various product categories at DMart.

ðŸ”‘ Key Metrics:

Total Sales: 1M
Brand Partners: 805
Average Price by SubCategory includes:
Smartwatches: â‚¹5999
Wonderchef: â‚¹5300
Butterfly: â‚¹4248
Kitchen Appliances: â‚¹3964
ðŸ“‰ Sales Distribution: A clear pie chart breakdown by categories like Personal Care, Packaged Food, Home & Kitchen, and more!

ðŸ’° Discount Analysis: Detailed info on discount percentages and prices offered, allowing for better inventory and pricing strategies.

Power BI (or your preferred tool) makes it easy to turn data into actionable insights! What do you think about this dashboard? Feel free to share your thoughts! ðŸ˜Š
